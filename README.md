How It Works
	1.	Input Options:
	•	You are prompted to enter a width and height in inches.
	•	If you leave either blank, the script calculates the missing dimension to maintain the aspect ratio.
	2.	DPI Conversion:
	•	Converts the provided inches into pixels using 96 DPI.
	3.	Aspect Ratio Preservation:
	•	If only one dimension is specified, the script calculates the other based on the original aspect ratio of the SVG.
	4.	Output Files:
